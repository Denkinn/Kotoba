# Kotoba, the dictionary of learned words application

## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to let each user save its own list of words, which he has learned in some language.

## Reason
The idea of making this came to me when I was learning a new language. Whenever I saw a new word, I wrote that down to my notebook.
In some time there was way too many words and I couldn't tell which word is already written down and which one is new.
So it would be convenient to store all the words in database, in which case search would be available and other features
as well.

## Features

- add new words to personal language dictionary list (with translations and pronunciations)
- search through added words for specific one (either by writing or translation)
- possible feature to do tests for words knowledge (choose random words from dictionary, choose right translation/pronunciation)
- _possible additional features_
